# MdedFusion
- We have uploaded fused images of some of the datasets:
  - **TNO**: A. Toet, "TNO image fusion dataset," 2014. https://figshare.com/articles/TNO_Image_Fusion_Dataset/1008029.
  - **RoadScene**: H. Xu, J. Ma, J. Jiang, X. Guo, and H. Ling, “U2Fusion: A unified unsupervised image fusion network,” IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., vol. 44, no. 1, pp. 502–518, 2022.
  - **M3FD**: J. Liu, X. Fan, Z. Huang, G. Wu, R. Liu, W. Zhong, Z. Luo, “Target aware dual adversarial learning and a multi-scenario multi-modality benchmark to fuse infrared and visible for object detection,” in Proc. IEEE* *Conf. Comput. Vis. Pattern Recognit. (CVPR), 2022, pp. 5802–5811.

- If you need fused images of any other dataset, you can contact me without hesitation via this email (tanghaojie111@163.com) (**_Note_**: please add your dataset as an attachment in the email).
